    <h1>Japanse cooking for busy people</h1>
    <h2> Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Japanese cooking is becoming more and more popular each year in the west and for good reason!
        <br>
        One problem people have with asian cooking, and japanese cooking in general is the perception of difficulty. Mysterious techniques and exotic ingredients often put people off but I'm here to tell you Japanse cooking is accessible to anyone, even busy people!

    <h2>Ingredients - What to use and where to get it</h2>
    <p>Most japanese recipes use a nearly identical list of ingredients for the base. In fact, the Japanse have a saying 'Sa Shi Su Se So'
        <br>
        <br>
        This mnemonic, which comes from the Japanese hiragana alphabet stands for the base ingredients used in a variety of dishes.
        <br>
        <br>
        SA - Satoh (Sugar)
        <br>
        SHI - Shio (Salt)
        <br>
        SU - Osu (Vinegar)
        <br>
        SE - Shoyu (Soy Sauce)
        <br>
        SO - Miso (Fermented soy bean paste)
        <br>
        <br>
        These ingredients can be found in the asian aisle in the supermarket or at asian grocery stores. If you can't find the exact ingredients, look out for chinese or korean alternatives and worst case scenario, we'll include some easier to find replacements.
